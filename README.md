My customized bower + npm + gulp web app template.

* install node.js, bower and gulp first up
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

* Change code in app/ folder
* `gulp` to prepare distribution in `dist` folder
* `gulp serve` to view the pages in a browser with live redeploy. Useful for development.

Todo:
- add source maps
- add a way for production deployment to automatically minimize app/ css and js files

Extended from the code provided by:

I am not a gulp or npm or bower expert; nor do I use these regularly. But I like having tools for build regardless of the language or platform!
